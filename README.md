# PING-PONG
This is a re-creation of the famous video game, PONG. It was a video game that was first released in 1972.

I created this as a small summer project to help me become familiarised with the JavaScript programming language.

Desirable modifications:
  - I would like to add in the functionality of a round counter to allow there to be round based succession.
  - Add in the functionality of the colour changing background. 
  - Create this to be a two player game, either client based or larger, this would be interesting as a side project.
  - Have a leaderboard to remember how many times I won against my friends as a permenant reminder of how much better I am at video games :)
    * However, this would require permenant data storage and my knowledge of that is not where I would like it to be.
